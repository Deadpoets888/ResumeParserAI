# ResumeParserAI
ResumeParserAI is an intelligent resume parsing and retrieval system using LLMs, OCR models, and vector embeddings to help recruiters find ideal candidates via natural language search. Built with FastAPI, React.js, PostgreSQL, and a Vector DB (Chroma/Pinecone), it turns raw resumes into structured, searchable data.
